### [2026-08-13 ~15:50] USER
i want to sync this git repo with my github account for coolnomad

### [2026-08-13 ~15:50] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Inspected the repo: empty (no commits/files), git already configured as user.name `coolnomad`, credential helper `manager`. `gh` CLI not installed; `winget` and elevated Chocolatey unavailable. Installed `gh` v2.97.0 as a portable binary at `C:\Users\dimuc\gh_cli\bin`. Found `gh` authenticated as a *different* account (`ddimuccigraphomics`) but able to see that `coolnomad/magic_the_gathering_theorycrafting` already exists (public, empty). Wired up remote `origin`, set local branch to `main`, verified connectivity.

### [2026-08-13 ~15:55] USER
creat the initial commit to verify as coolnomad

### [2026-08-13 ~15:55] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Created `README.md`, committed as "Initial commit" (`ff1c66a`), and pushed to `origin main`. Verified on the remote that the commit landed authored by `coolnomad`, confirming write access. Local `main` tracks `origin/main`.

### [2026-08-13 ~16:00] USER
add gh to my path

### [2026-08-13 ~16:00] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Added `C:\Users\dimuc\gh_cli\bin` to the persistent user PATH and verified `gh` resolves (v2.97.0). Noted that `gh` is still authed as `ddimuccigraphomics`, not `coolnomad`.

### [2026-08-13 16:02] USER
ok now on to the business of this repo. what i want to do in here is develop a mechanistic theory for limited magic the gathering formats. first emphasis is on draft format. what I want to do is set up a persistent append only labnotebook in this repo. and also a persistent append only conversation log - every message i send you and response you give should be appended to it. and create an instructions.md file or something similar for any LLM i fire up in this repo to read and know the rules.

### [2026-08-13 16:02] ASSISTANT
Set up the project scaffolding:
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — the rules-of-the-repo file for any LLM/human: mission (mechanistic theory of Limited MTG, Draft first), the three append-only artifacts, append-only discipline, conversation-log rules, lab-notebook entry format/types, and working principles.
- `CLAUDE.md` — short pointer so Claude Code auto-loads and obeys `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- `LABNOTEBOOK.md` — append-only scientific record, seeded with a kickoff DECISION entry and an opening QUESTION entry.
- `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` — this file; append-only transcript, bootstrapped with the session so far.
Flagged that guaranteed per-turn logging is best enforced by a Claude Code hook and offered to set one up.

### [2026-08-13 16:40] USER
yes set those hooks up. add the gitattributes to normalize it.

### [2026-08-13 16:40] ASSISTANT
Built the append-only logging infrastructure (this turn appended by hand, since the hooks aren't active until `/hooks`/restart):
- `.claude/hooks/log_user.ps1` — UserPromptSubmit hook, appends the user prompt.
- `.claude/hooks/log_assistant.ps1` — Stop hook, parses the session transcript and appends the assistant reply, de-duplicated by message uuid.
- `.claude/settings.json` — registers both with `shell: "powershell"`.
- `.gitattributes` — normalizes line endings (LF in repo; `*.ps1` CRLF).
Pipe-tested both scripts against a temp log + synthetic transcript: correct boundary detection (skips pre-prompt answers and tool_result entries), multi-part text stitching across tool calls, and working dedup. Updated `INSTRUCTIONS.md` §7 and logged a `DECISION` in `LABNOTEBOOK.md`. Told the user to run `/hooks` (or restart) to activate, and that other terminals need a restart to see `gh` on PATH.

### [2026-08-13 16:49] USER
keep it, and let's start on the theory

### [2026-08-13 16:49] ASSISTANT
Read the full HOB KG spec and used it to set the epistemic bar. Laid down the foundational theory block in `LABNOTEBOOK.md` (append-only): a DECISION defining the **capacity stack** (L0 rules → L1 mechanistic possibility graph = the HOB KG → L2 game-state physics → L3 deck-as-capacity-vector → L4 draft-as-sequential-decision → L5 outcomes), with the rule that a layer-N claim needs layer-≥N evidence. Then DEFINITIONs of the Limited game state + five resource primitives (cards, mana, tempo, board, life); tempo & card advantage as orthogonal axes of resource exchange measured in **mana-turns**; card quality Q0 (vacuum) vs Qc (contextual, with synergy from L1 KG paths) tied to the confounded 17Lands-style observables (ALSA/ATA/GIH WR/IWD); and "playable" as replacement-relative (VORP-style). Added HYPOTHESIS H1 (Exchange-Rate) with falsifiable predictions, a Bayesian DEFINITION of draft signals/"open," a MODEL of the pick decision as value-function maximization (subsuming BREAD), EXPERIMENT E1 to test H1 on real data, and a QUESTION entry with the roadmap/open dependencies. Noted the logging hooks are still inactive and asked where to deepen next.

Detected hooks still inactive (the current user message was absent from the log), so appended this turn manually.

### [2026-08-13 17:00] USER
where did these hypotheses come from? you just invented them?

### [2026-08-13 17:00] ASSISTANT
Owned it honestly: yes, I wrote them. Broke down provenance — established Magic strategy folklore (tempo/card advantage, the clock, removal/bombs, BREAD; the 17Lands metrics and their selection-bias confound) vs. imported analogies (VORP/replacement level, Bayesian signaling) vs. my own invented synthesis (the capacity stack, resource-exchange vector, mana-turns unit, Q0/Qc, the H1 naming and predictions). Acknowledged the framing was mine, presented over-confidently and with no provenance, violating the repo's own "cite reality" rule and the KG spec's provenance principle #10. Offered three fixes: (1) provenance pass, (2) verify against real sources first, (3) rebuild bottom-up. Saved a `feedback` memory (`provenance-rigor`) about the user's standard.

### [2026-08-13 17:05] USER
3 - we'll throw out the whole packaging that you came up with. stick strictly to the document I uploaded so far. when it's time to expand I will tell you. for now, throw out your packaging - don't take any action yet.

### [2026-08-13 17:05] ASSISTANT
Confirmed option 3 and took no action as instructed. Stated the uploaded HOB KG spec is the sole authoritative source until told to expand. Asked two scoping questions for when it's time to clean up: (a) scope — just the 16:49 block or also the 16:02 opening questions / INSTRUCTIONS elaborations; (b) method — hard-delete vs. append-only retraction entry. Flagged that the log still isn't auto-capturing turns.

### [2026-08-13 17:15] USER
just the 16:49 block, leave a retraction entry. don't delete the history - just write that it's retracted. i'll next restart the session so the hooks are active.

### [2026-08-13 17:15] ASSISTANT
Appended an append-only `CORRECTION` entry to `LABNOTEBOOK.md` retracting the entire 2026-08-13 16:49 theory block (listed each retracted entry, gave the reason and the user's direction, scoped the retraction to only that block, preserved all history). Reconciled `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` with the turns since the last entry (this block). Committed and pushed. Noted the user will restart to activate the logging hooks, after which turns are captured automatically.




### [2026-08-13 17:24] USER
are you up to speed on the instructions?

### [2026-08-13 17:24] ASSISTANT
Let me actually read the instructions before claiming to be up to speed.

Yes. I've re-read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `LABNOTEBOOK.md`, and `CONVERSATION_LOG.md`. Here's my understanding:

**Mission:** Build a *mechanistic* theory of Limited MTG â€” Draft first. Explicit, falsifiable, mechanics-grounded models, not heuristics/vibes.

**Append-only discipline (non-negotiable):** `LABNOTEBOOK.md` and `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` are append-only. Never edit/reorder/delete. Corrections and retractions are *new* entries that reference the originals. History (including dead ends) is preserved on purpose.

**Every turn:** the exchange gets appended to `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` (user verbatim + assistant response). Science â€” definitions, hypotheses, experiments, results, decisions â€” goes into `LABNOTEBOOK.md` in the dated `## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] TYPE â€” Title` format.

**Working principles:** falsifiability first, define before building load-bearingly, cite reality (no vibes), preserve dead ends, small frequent commits.

**Current state I'm carrying forward â€” the important part:**
- The entire **2026-08-13 16:49 theory block was retracted** (the capacity stack L0â€“L5, resource-exchange/mana-turns, Q0/Qc, H1, the BREAD-as-value-function model, E1, etc.). That was framing *I invented* without provenance â€” voided, not deleted.
- Per your direction, the **sole authoritative source right now is `docs/hob-knowledge-graph-build-spec.md`**. I introduce no new architectures, definitions, hypotheses, or models beyond that document until you say it's time to expand.
- The 16:02 kickoff DECISION and opening QUESTION entries still stand.

**On the hooks:** the log already contains your current message ("are you up to speed on the instructions?") at the end of `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` â€” so the `UserPromptSubmit` hook fired. Looks like your restart activated logging. I'll assume the `Stop` hook captures my replies now and won't hand-append (which would risk double-logging), but I'll keep an eye on it.

One thing I haven't done yet this session is actually read the authoritative doc's contents into this context. Want me to read `docs/hob-knowledge-graph-build-spec.md` now so I'm working from it directly, or are we picking up somewhere specific?

### [2026-08-13 17:25] USER
read that doc

### [2026-08-13 17:26] ASSISTANT
Read in full. Here's what it actually is, so we're aligned on the authoritative source:

**It's a build spec for one concrete deliverable** â€” a rules-grounded mechanistic knowledge graph for the **193 mechanically unique cards of *MTGâ€”The Hobbit* (HOB)**. It is *not* a theory of Limited, and it is deliberately scoped to stop short of one.

**What it commits to:**
- **Objective:** capture what each card *can* do mechanically â€” what its operations consume/produce, what states enable them, how one card's outputs can satisfy another's requirements. Pure rules-defined possibility.
- **Hard prohibition (the epistemic spine):** no card quality, win rate, draft stats, archetype labels, ratings, or "synergizes with." Those are explicitly deferred to "later layers." Principle #7: "No value judgments." Principle #10: every asserted primitive edge needs provenance back to card face / Oracle span / comprehensive rule / release note.
- **Graph model:** typed, directed property multigraph with reified gate/transition nodes. Cards are *not* the only nodes â€” faces, abilities, operations, events, resources, zones, object classes, counters, states, gates, costs, effects, rules. Pair relations are *derived views* (a path through intermediate nodes), never primitive asserted edges. Direction is mandatory (`Aâ†’B` â‰  `Bâ†’A`).
- **Higher-order mechanisms as gates, not enumeration:** Storied is one distinct-object-count gate (â‰¥3 legendary/artifact/Saga â†’ `enduring_story`), explicitly *not* ~1.18M triples. Recruit, Hone, Adventure, Saga each get reusable rule templates.
- **Pipeline:** Phase 0 freeze scope â†’ 1 deterministic normalization (no LLM) â†’ 2 mechanic templates â†’ 3 LLM semantic extraction (per-face, JSON-only, with an independent critic second pass) â†’ 4 assembly â†’ 5 derive all 37,249 ordered-pair projections by bounded path traversal â†’ 6 higher-order modules by grouping around gates.
- **Completion / final boundary:** it establishes *"component A can produce/enable/modify/prevent/consume/satisfy something used by B, given the rules."* It explicitly does **not** establish that a pairing improves win rate, is worth drafting, or is empirical synergy â€” those need outcomes, selection/skill adjustment, and replay evidence.

**How this squares with the project:** this document is the sole authoritative source right now. It is the **L1 "possibility" layer only** â€” and its own text is what draws the line I invented-then-retracted across (the L1â†’L5 gap, the "cite reality / provenance" bar). So the standing constraint is clear: I don't reintroduce quality, tempo, card-advantage, archetype, or draft-signal machinery, because *this document deliberately refuses to*. That's next-layer work you'll greenlight when it's time.

I'm working from it directly now. What's next?

### [2026-08-13 17:27] USER
pull the oracle text for HOB that the document describes and store it in this repo.

### [2026-08-13 17:31] ASSISTANT
I'll fetch it from the Scryfall API exactly as the spec describes: `set:hob`, unique cards, excluding extras. First let me probe that the set exists and see what comes back.

Set exists â€” 193 cards, matches the spec exactly. Now I'll page through all results, save the raw snapshot with a timestamp + hash manifest, and verify the counts the spec asserts (193 total, 17 Adventure, 8 Saga).

All counts match the spec's expected payload exactly. Let me verify the three mechanic-text counts the spec also lists (10 Recruit, 9 Storied, 2 hone) to fully confirm the snapshot is the one the document describes.

Every count matches the spec's expected payload precisely:

| Spec expectation | Fetched | âœ“ |
|---|---|---|
| Unique cards | 193 | âœ“ |
| Normal layouts | 168 | âœ“ |
| Adventure layouts | 17 | âœ“ |
| Saga layouts | 8 | âœ“ |
| No top-level `oracle_text` | 17 | âœ“ |
| `produced_mana` | 23 | âœ“ |
| `all_parts` | 49 | âœ“ |
| Recruit texts | 10 | âœ“ |
| Storied texts | 9 | âœ“ |
| hone-counter texts | 2 | âœ“ |

This is exactly the corpus the document describes. Now let me record the acquisition in the lab notebook (append-only).

Done. The HOB Oracle-text corpus is now stored in the repo:

- **`data/raw/scryfall_hob.json`** â€” 193 raw Scryfall card objects (UTF-8, no BOM, 1.6 MB). This holds the Oracle text for all normal-layout cards at top level and the Adventure/Saga face text under `card_faces`.
- **`data/raw/source_manifest.json`** â€” frozen-snapshot metadata (exact query, UTC retrieval timestamp, SHA-256 hash, byte size, counts), satisfying the spec's "builds must be reproducible from a frozen source snapshot" requirement.
- Lab-notebook `OBSERVATION` entry appended recording the fetch and the count verification.

The snapshot reproduces **every count the document asserts** (193 cards; 168/17/8 normal/Adventure/Saga; 17 faceless-top-level; 23 produced-mana; 49 all-parts; 10 Recruit / 9 Storied / 2 hone), so this is provably the corpus the spec describes.

Two notes:
1. This is **Phase 0 data acquisition only** â€” raw source, no normalization/graph/theory, consistent with the standing "stick to the document" directive.
2. The spec's "Required" corpus also lists the **official HOB release notes / mechanics article** and the **Comprehensive Rules** text. You only asked for the Oracle text, so I fetched just the Scryfall payload â€” those two remain outstanding whenever you want them.

Want me to commit this snapshot now, or leave it uncommitted for now?

### [2026-08-13 17:32] USER
commit this

### [2026-08-13 18:25] ASSISTANT
Committed to `main` as `2783f7c`:

- `data/raw/scryfall_hob.json` (193 cards) + `data/raw/source_manifest.json` (frozen-snapshot metadata)
- `LABNOTEBOOK.md` OBSERVATION entry + `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` (hook-captured)

I left `.claude/hooks/.last_assistant_uuid` uncommitted â€” that's the logging hook's local dedup state, not something that should be tracked. Say the word if you'd like me to add it to `.gitignore`. Nothing pushed (you didn't ask); let me know if you want it on the remote.

### [2026-08-13 18:26] USER
push it

### [2026-08-13 18:26] ASSISTANT
Pushed â€” `d96e36e..2783f7c` is now on `origin/main`.

The snapshot and lab-notebook entry are live on GitHub. `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` shows as modified again because the logging hook appended this exchange after the commit â€” that'll roll into the next commit.

### [2026-08-13 18:32] USER
ok now collect the rest of the required sources as detailed in the spec

### [2026-08-13 18:38] ASSISTANT
The spec's "Required" corpus has two remaining items beyond the Scryfall payload:
- **`hob_release_notes.html`** + **`hob_mechanics.html`** â€” official HOB release notes & mechanics article
- **`comprehensive_rules.txt`** â€” current Magic Comprehensive Rules

Let me load the web tools and pull HOB set metadata (release date helps me get the right rules version and confirms official page timing).

"The Hobbit" (`hob`) is a real expansion releasing **2026-08-14** (tomorrow). So the official release notes and mechanics article should be freshly posted. Let me locate all three sources.

Found all three official pages. Let me get the current Comprehensive Rules `.txt` download URL from the rules page, and test whether the article HTML is directly downloadable (WotC pages sometimes sit behind Cloudflare/JS).

All three sources are reachable:
- Release notes & mechanics article: directly downloadable HTML (200, mechanic text present).
- Comprehensive Rules: current TXT is dated **2026-08-07** â€” the HOB-era update (a week before release), which already incorporates hone counters and the new battle rule 310.8 the release notes mention. Exactly the "current" version the spec wants.

Downloading all three to `data/raw/` and rebuilding the manifest to cover every source with hashes.

Let me verify the Comprehensive Rules file is genuine (correct header, and that it actually contains the new HOB rules â€” hone counters and battle rule 310.8) before finalizing.

Confirmed genuine â€” correct header, "effective as of August 7, 2026," rule 122.1j (hone counter) and rule 310.8 (non-Siege battle SBA) both present, matching what the release notes flagged. All four required sources are now in `data/raw/`. Rebuilding the manifest to cover all of them.

All four required-corpus files are in place. Recording the acquisition in the lab notebook.

The spec's entire **Required** source corpus is now snapshotted in `data/raw/`:

| File | Source | Size | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scryfall_hob.json` | Scryfall `set:hob` unique cards | 1.6 MB | 193 cards, all counts âœ“ (prior turn) |
| `hob_release_notes.html` | wizards.com release notes | 392 KB | mechanic text present âœ“ |
| `hob_mechanics.html` | wizards.com mechanics article | 193 KB | Recruit/Storied/hone âœ“ |
| `comprehensive_rules.txt` | media.wizards.com CR, eff. 2026-08-07 | 977 KB | rule 122.1j + 310.8 âœ“ |
| `source_manifest.json` | â€” | 3 KB | 4-source manifest w/ hashes |

Key checks:
- **HOB is a real expansion** (Scryfall: "The Hobbit", released 2026-08-14 â€” tomorrow), so these are the freshly-posted official pages.
- The **Comprehensive Rules are the correct HOB-era version** (effective Aug 7, 2026), not a stale one â€” it already carries the two rule changes the release notes flag (hone counters at 122.1j, the new battle SBA at 310.8).
- Lab notebook OBSERVATION entry appended.

Two honest notes: the release-notes/mechanics HTML is the full rendered page (nav/scripts included), which is fine as a raw snapshot â€” parsing extracts the content in Phase 1. And I fetched only the "Required" list; the spec doesn't require the separate Vision-Design or Update-Bulletin articles, so I left those.

Want me to commit and push this, same as before?

### [2026-08-13 18:38] USER
commit and push it

### [2026-08-13 18:40] ASSISTANT
The line-ending warnings matter here: these raw sources are hash-pinned in the manifest, but `.gitattributes` will normalize them, changing their bytes so a fresh checkout won't match the recorded SHA-256s. That breaks the spec's "reproducible from a frozen snapshot" guarantee. Let me check and fix before committing.

`.gitattributes` normalizes everything text-like, which would rewrite the bytes of these hash-pinned snapshots. I'll exempt `data/raw/**` so the frozen sources are stored byte-exact, then renormalize the index (including the already-committed `scryfall_hob.json`) so every checkout reproduces the recorded hashes.

All four hashes match the manifest, and `scryfall_hob.json` is re-staged byte-exact (the `-text` renormalize corrected the earlier normalized blob). Committing and pushing.

Committed and pushed â€” `2783f7c..817994e` is now on `origin/main`.

The spec's full **Required** source corpus is captured and reproducible:

- `data/raw/scryfall_hob.json`, `hob_release_notes.html`, `hob_mechanics.html`, `comprehensive_rules.txt` (+ `source_manifest.json`)
- All four SHA-256 hashes verified against the manifest, and `data/raw/** -text` in `.gitattributes` ensures every checkout reproduces those exact bytes (I also renormalized the earlier `scryfall_hob.json` blob so it's now byte-exact too).
- Lab notebook OBSERVATION entry recorded; `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` rolled in.

That completes **Phase 0 (initialize and freeze scope)** data acquisition from the spec. Nothing normalized, graphed, or theorized â€” still strictly the frozen raw snapshot, per the standing directive.

The only working-tree item left is `.claude/hooks/.last_assistant_uuid` (the logging hook's local dedup state), still intentionally untracked. Whenever you're ready to move forward, the next spec step would be Phase 1 deterministic normalization â€” but I'll wait for your go.

### [2026-08-13 18:40] USER
next collect the same information but for the final fantasy set: FIN is the code. once HOB is figured out we'll transfer to FIN

### [2026-08-13 18:50] ASSISTANT
FIN = *Magic: The Gatheringâ€”Final Fantasy* (Universes Beyond), a real 2025 set. I'll run the same Phase 0 collection. To avoid filename collisions with HOB (both would have `comprehensive_rules.txt` etc.), I'll put FIN's snapshot in its own `data/raw/fin/` subdirectory. Let me pull set metadata and locate the official pages.

FIN located: *Final Fantasy* (`fin`), expansion, released **2025-06-13**, **313 mechanically unique** cards (595 in the print gallery). Official pages found:
- Release notes: `final-fantasy-release-notes`
- Mechanics: `final-fantasy-mechanics`

To mirror HOB, I'll grab the **FIN-era** Comprehensive Rules (the version shipped with FIN, which the release notes' Saga update landed in). Let me fetch all FIN cards + save them, and locate the FIN-era CR.

FIN card data saved (313 unique: 263 normal, 27 transform, 15 Saga, 5 Adventure, 3 meld). The **FIN-era Comprehensive Rules are effective 2025-06-06** (the Friday before FIN's June 13 release â€” the version the Saga rules update landed in). Downloading the two articles and the FIN-era CR `.txt`.

Verified â€” the FIN-era CR (effective **June 6, 2025**) is correct, including rule 714.2d (Saga with no chapter abilities â€” the FIN update), and both articles contain the FIN mechanics (Job select, Saga, Summon). Building the FIN manifest.

All hashes verified. `data/raw/** -text` already covers the new `data/raw/fin/` subdir, so these are stored byte-exact too. Recording in the lab notebook.

FIN's Phase 0 corpus is collected in `data/raw/fin/`, mirroring HOB:

| File | Source | Size | Verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scryfall_fin.json` | Scryfall `set:fin` unique cards | 2.8 MB | 313 unique (263 normal, 27 transform, 15 Saga, 5 Adventure, 3 meld) |
| `fin_release_notes.html` | wizards.com release notes | 1.1 MB | Job select/Saga/Summon present âœ“ |
| `fin_mechanics.html` | wizards.com mechanics article | 191 KB | Job select/Saga/Summon present âœ“ |
| `comprehensive_rules.txt` | CR eff. **2025-06-06** (FIN-era) | 950 KB | rule 714.2d (Saga update) âœ“ |
| `source_manifest.json` | â€” | 4 KB | 4-source manifest, all hashes match |

Notes worth flagging:
- **Layout choice:** FIN lives in `data/raw/fin/` to avoid filename collisions with HOB (which stays at `data/raw/` root). Recorded a DECISION entry; if you'd rather symmetrize later, moving HOB into `data/raw/hob/` is easy. The `data/raw/** -text` rule already keeps FIN byte-exact.
- **CR is FIN-era, not current** â€” effective 2025-06-06 (the version FIN shipped with), to faithfully mirror how we grabbed the HOB-era CR. It contains rule 714.2d, the Saga change the FIN release notes announce.
- **FIN has mechanics the HOB spec doesn't template** â€” Saga creatures ("Summon"), Job select, tiered spells, transforming DFCs, meld. I noted in the notebook that these will need new Phase 2 rule templates when we transfer the pipeline, so the transfer step doesn't silently assume HOB's template set covers FIN.

Two OBSERVATION + one DECISION entries appended to the lab notebook. Want me to commit and push, same as before?
