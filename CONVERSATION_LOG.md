### [2026-08-13 ~15:50] USER
i want to sync this git repo with my github account for coolnomad

### [2026-08-13 ~15:50] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Inspected the repo: empty (no commits/files), git already configured as user.name `coolnomad`, credential helper `manager`. `gh` CLI not installed; `winget` and elevated Chocolatey unavailable. Installed `gh` v2.97.0 as a portable binary at `C:\Users\dimuc\gh_cli\bin`. Found `gh` authenticated as a *different* account (`ddimuccigraphomics`) but able to see that `coolnomad/magic_the_gathering_theorycrafting` already exists (public, empty). Wired up remote `origin`, set local branch to `main`, verified connectivity.

### [2026-08-13 ~15:55] USER
creat the initial commit to verify as coolnomad

### [2026-08-13 ~15:55] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Created `README.md`, committed as "Initial commit" (`ff1c66a`), and pushed to `origin main`. Verified on the remote that the commit landed authored by `coolnomad`, confirming write access. Local `main` tracks `origin/main`.

### [2026-08-13 ~16:00] USER
add gh to my path

### [2026-08-13 ~16:00] ASSISTANT (summarized — pre-logging setup)
Added `C:\Users\dimuc\gh_cli\bin` to the persistent user PATH and verified `gh` resolves (v2.97.0). Noted that `gh` is still authed as `ddimuccigraphomics`, not `coolnomad`.

### [2026-08-13 16:02] USER
ok now on to the business of this repo. what i want to do in here is develop a mechanistic theory for limited magic the gathering formats. first emphasis is on draft format. what I want to do is set up a persistent append only labnotebook in this repo. and also a persistent append only conversation log - every message i send you and response you give should be appended to it. and create an instructions.md file or something similar for any LLM i fire up in this repo to read and know the rules.

### [2026-08-13 16:02] ASSISTANT
Set up the project scaffolding:
- `INSTRUCTIONS.md` — the rules-of-the-repo file for any LLM/human: mission (mechanistic theory of Limited MTG, Draft first), the three append-only artifacts, append-only discipline, conversation-log rules, lab-notebook entry format/types, and working principles.
- `CLAUDE.md` — short pointer so Claude Code auto-loads and obeys `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- `LABNOTEBOOK.md` — append-only scientific record, seeded with a kickoff DECISION entry and an opening QUESTION entry.
- `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` — this file; append-only transcript, bootstrapped with the session so far.
Flagged that guaranteed per-turn logging is best enforced by a Claude Code hook and offered to set one up.

### [2026-08-13 16:40] USER
yes set those hooks up. add the gitattributes to normalize it.

### [2026-08-13 16:40] ASSISTANT
Built the append-only logging infrastructure (this turn appended by hand, since the hooks aren't active until `/hooks`/restart):
- `.claude/hooks/log_user.ps1` — UserPromptSubmit hook, appends the user prompt.
- `.claude/hooks/log_assistant.ps1` — Stop hook, parses the session transcript and appends the assistant reply, de-duplicated by message uuid.
- `.claude/settings.json` — registers both with `shell: "powershell"`.
- `.gitattributes` — normalizes line endings (LF in repo; `*.ps1` CRLF).
Pipe-tested both scripts against a temp log + synthetic transcript: correct boundary detection (skips pre-prompt answers and tool_result entries), multi-part text stitching across tool calls, and working dedup. Updated `INSTRUCTIONS.md` §7 and logged a `DECISION` in `LABNOTEBOOK.md`. Told the user to run `/hooks` (or restart) to activate, and that other terminals need a restart to see `gh` on PATH.

### [2026-08-13 16:49] USER
keep it, and let's start on the theory

### [2026-08-13 16:49] ASSISTANT
Read the full HOB KG spec and used it to set the epistemic bar. Laid down the foundational theory block in `LABNOTEBOOK.md` (append-only): a DECISION defining the **capacity stack** (L0 rules → L1 mechanistic possibility graph = the HOB KG → L2 game-state physics → L3 deck-as-capacity-vector → L4 draft-as-sequential-decision → L5 outcomes), with the rule that a layer-N claim needs layer-≥N evidence. Then DEFINITIONs of the Limited game state + five resource primitives (cards, mana, tempo, board, life); tempo & card advantage as orthogonal axes of resource exchange measured in **mana-turns**; card quality Q0 (vacuum) vs Qc (contextual, with synergy from L1 KG paths) tied to the confounded 17Lands-style observables (ALSA/ATA/GIH WR/IWD); and "playable" as replacement-relative (VORP-style). Added HYPOTHESIS H1 (Exchange-Rate) with falsifiable predictions, a Bayesian DEFINITION of draft signals/"open," a MODEL of the pick decision as value-function maximization (subsuming BREAD), EXPERIMENT E1 to test H1 on real data, and a QUESTION entry with the roadmap/open dependencies. Noted the logging hooks are still inactive and asked where to deepen next.

Detected hooks still inactive (the current user message was absent from the log), so appended this turn manually.

### [2026-08-13 17:00] USER
where did these hypotheses come from? you just invented them?

### [2026-08-13 17:00] ASSISTANT
Owned it honestly: yes, I wrote them. Broke down provenance — established Magic strategy folklore (tempo/card advantage, the clock, removal/bombs, BREAD; the 17Lands metrics and their selection-bias confound) vs. imported analogies (VORP/replacement level, Bayesian signaling) vs. my own invented synthesis (the capacity stack, resource-exchange vector, mana-turns unit, Q0/Qc, the H1 naming and predictions). Acknowledged the framing was mine, presented over-confidently and with no provenance, violating the repo's own "cite reality" rule and the KG spec's provenance principle #10. Offered three fixes: (1) provenance pass, (2) verify against real sources first, (3) rebuild bottom-up. Saved a `feedback` memory (`provenance-rigor`) about the user's standard.

### [2026-08-13 17:05] USER
3 - we'll throw out the whole packaging that you came up with. stick strictly to the document I uploaded so far. when it's time to expand I will tell you. for now, throw out your packaging - don't take any action yet.

### [2026-08-13 17:05] ASSISTANT
Confirmed option 3 and took no action as instructed. Stated the uploaded HOB KG spec is the sole authoritative source until told to expand. Asked two scoping questions for when it's time to clean up: (a) scope — just the 16:49 block or also the 16:02 opening questions / INSTRUCTIONS elaborations; (b) method — hard-delete vs. append-only retraction entry. Flagged that the log still isn't auto-capturing turns.

### [2026-08-13 17:15] USER
just the 16:49 block, leave a retraction entry. don't delete the history - just write that it's retracted. i'll next restart the session so the hooks are active.

### [2026-08-13 17:15] ASSISTANT
Appended an append-only `CORRECTION` entry to `LABNOTEBOOK.md` retracting the entire 2026-08-13 16:49 theory block (listed each retracted entry, gave the reason and the user's direction, scoped the retraction to only that block, preserved all history). Reconciled `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` with the turns since the last entry (this block). Committed and pushed. Noted the user will restart to activate the logging hooks, after which turns are captured automatically.
