## [2026-08-13 16:02] DECISION — Project kickoff and scope

Established this repository as the home for developing a **mechanistic theory of Limited Magic: The Gathering formats**, with **Draft as the first emphasis**.

- "Mechanistic" = explicit, falsifiable models grounded in game mechanics, not heuristics or vibes.
- "Limited" = deck built from a freshly-opened restricted pool (Draft, Sealed). Draft is the initial focus; Sealed and others come later.
- Set up three persistent artifacts: this lab notebook, `CONVERSATION_LOG.md` (append-only transcript), and `INSTRUCTIONS.md` (repo rules). All governed by append-only discipline.

## [2026-08-13 16:02] QUESTION — Opening questions to eventually address

Seed list of open questions to structure early work (each to be promoted to HYPOTHESIS/EXPERIMENT as it sharpens):

1. What are the primitive quantities of a Limited game? (mana, tempo, card advantage, board presence, life total, information)
2. How do we operationally define "card quality" in a vacuum vs. in-context (archetype, pool, seat)?
3. What is a "signal" during a draft, mechanistically, and how should a drafter update on it?
4. Can pick order be modeled as decision-making under uncertainty with a value function over future deck states?
5. What observable, measurable outcomes will we use to validate models (win rate, game length, mana efficiency curves)?

## [2026-08-13 16:40] DECISION — Automated conversation logging via hooks

Wired up append-only conversation logging so the record captures itself:

- `.claude/hooks/log_user.ps1` (UserPromptSubmit) appends each user prompt.
- `.claude/hooks/log_assistant.ps1` (Stop) parses the session transcript and appends the assistant's reply for the just-finished turn, de-duplicated by message uuid so re-fires (resume/compact) don't double-log.
- Both registered in `.claude/settings.json` with `shell: "powershell"`; BOM-free UTF-8 appends; self-locating via `$PSScriptRoot`; fail silently so a hook error never blocks a turn.
- Added `.gitattributes` to normalize line endings (LF in repo; `*.ps1` stays CRLF).

Note: the hooks activate for a Claude Code session only after `/hooks` (or restart) if `.claude/settings.json` didn't exist at session start.
